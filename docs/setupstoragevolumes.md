### Storage Volumes

An OpenEBS Volume comprises of Target and Replica component. There can be one or more Replicas. The Replica component accesses the underlying disk resources for storing the data. Target component is used by an application. Storage volumes must be persistent with the application.

OpenEBS storage provides several features that can be customised for each volume. Some of the features that can be customised per application are as follows:

- Number of replications
- Zone or node affinity
- Volume expansion policy
- Replication policy


There are two types of storage volumes in OpenEBS.

1. Jiva storage volume 
2. Cstor storage volume


### Jiva Storage Volume

Jiva storage engine creates Jiva volume. By default, OpenEBS Jiva volume runs with 3 replicas.
This sample PVC yaml uses storage class **openebs-jiva-default** created as part of **openebs-operator** YAML installation.

You can create the Jiva volume by using the following command.

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openebs/openebs/master/k8s/demo/pvc-standard-jiva-default.yaml
```

Get the Jiva pvc details by running the following command.

```
kubectl get pvc
```

Get the Jiva pv details by running the following command.

```
kubectl get pv
```

This pvc name is used in application yaml to run application using OpenEBS Jiva volume.

Get the percona deployment YAML using following command.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openebs/openebs/master/k8s/demo/percona/percona-openebs-deployment.yaml
```

Edit the downloaded file by changing the storage class name to **openebs-jiva-default** from **openebs-standard**.

Apply the modified YAML to create the Jiva Volume using following command.

```
kubectl apply -f percona-openebs-deployment.yaml
```

### Cstor Storage Volume

cStor storage engine creates cStor volume. By default, OpenEBS cStor volume will be running with 3 replicas. 
This sample PVC yaml uses storage class **openebs-cstor-sparse** created as part of **openebs-operator** YAML installation.

You can create the cStor volume by running the following command.

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openebs/openebs/master/k8s/demo/pvc-standard-cstor-default.yaml
```

If you want to create cStor volume on cStor Pool created using external disks, you can find the details [here](/docs/next/deploycstor.html).


Get the cStor pvc details by running the following command.

```
kubectl get pvc
```

Get the cStor pv details by running the following command.

```
kubectl get pv
```

This pvc name is used in the application yaml to run the application using OpenEBS cStor volume.

cStor volume can also be created dynamically. You can get the application yaml file using following command.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openebs/openebs/master/k8s/demo/percona/percona-openebs-deployment.yaml
```

Edit the downloaded file by changing the storage class name to **openebs-cstor-sparse** from **openebs-standard**.

Apply the modified YAML to create the cStor Volume using following command.

```
kubectl apply -f percona-openebs-deployment.yaml
```
